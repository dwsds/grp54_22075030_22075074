# Well-Nest
*A Health App*
</br></br>
Maintaining a proper diet is crucial for overall health. It provides essential nutrients,
aids in weight management, prevents diseases, improves mental health, boosts energy levels,
aids digestion, supports healthy aging, enhances sleep quality, and optimizes physical performance.
A balanced diet, rich in a variety of foods, is key to achieving these benefits.
        
At WELL-NEST, we understand the importance of your health. That's why we use the Subjective Global Assessment (SGA)
to evaluate your nutritional status. SGA is a reliable tool that helps us assess your health based on clinical parameters.
It allows us to provide personalized guidance to ensure your diet is supporting your well-being.
        
Our health app takes your personal and existing medical information into account and guides you on whether your current diet
is sufficient for your health needs. We are dedicated to helping you make informed decisions about your nutrition for a healthier life.
